%Matlab adaptive quadrature adaptq.m
%TODO: 
%fix midpoint rule
%test
%error prediction and correction
%can we use variance on the samples weve collected to make better
%predictions for step size?

function R = adaptq_halfsteps_reuseSteps(f, a, b, tau)
%model after the stepwise midpoint/trapezoidal method
%Move from a to b in steps.
%At each step approximate the integral over
%the current step, and the error in the approximation.
%Accept the approximation if the error is sufficiently small, otherwise reject it and take a
%smaller step
% Based on the information created in the previous step, calculate a new stepsize.
%Repeat items 2â€“4 until done.

% Thus in building our algorithm we will
%ignore the higher order terms. This assumption is fundamental in most ODE and PDE
%solvers. 

%step size selection
%require e_n <= (h_n/(b-a))tau]
%For efficiency, the stepsize should
%be such that the inequality in (13) is satisfied as closely as possible by equality
